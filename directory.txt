We have different folder of different classes. 
We have placed images from each dataset to 10 folders.
Each of the 10 folder represents to 10 classes.
Then we zipped it and uploaded it in dropbox.

We were training using Google's Colab service.
For each training period we downloaded full training data from dropbox to colab.
Then rest of the directory preparation work is done in notebook.

Our target is to build this structure,

|-- submission.csv
|-- data
    |-- train 
	    |-- 0
